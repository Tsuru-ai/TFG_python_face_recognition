### Introduction

This project is an implementation crafted in Google Colaboratory for people who are just getting into the exciting world of Facial Recognition and Machine Learning.

To operate this project, you only have to take the following steps:
1. Download this repository and unzip its content
2. Access to your Google Drive ([create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) if not) and upload the main folder named _Programa_ at your _My Drive_ folder.
3. Connect _Colaboratory_ app to your Drive desktop:
  - right click -> more -> connect more apps. 
  - Search _Colaboratory_ at Google Workspace Marketplace. 
  - Install
4. Open _Principal.ipnb_.

**VERY IMPORTANT**

If it's your first time on Colaboratory, by default your runtime enviroment will be setted as _CPU_, but for running this project we need access to _GPU_. To do so, access to Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> Hardware Accelerator -> GPU.
